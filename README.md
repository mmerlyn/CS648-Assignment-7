# CS648 - Assignment 7: JavaScript Functions, Events, and Arrays

## Overview

This assignment demonstrates proficiency in JavaScript fundamentals including functions, the event model, arrays, and web storage concepts.

## Assignment Components

### Part 1: Practice with Functions (5 points)

Developed several utility functions to practice parameter passing, return values, and type conversion:

- `halfNumber()` - Divides a number by 2 and logs the result
- `squareNumber()` - Squares a number and logs the result
- `percentOf()` - Calculates percentage of one number relative to another
- `findModulus()` - Computes modulus of two numbers
- Dynamic sum calculator - Accepts comma-delimited numbers via prompt and calculates their sum

### Part 2: Rock, Paper, Scissors Game (10 points)

Implemented a command-line Rock, Paper, Scissors game featuring:

- User input collection via prompts
- Random computer choice generation
- Win/loss/tie logic using conditionals
- Input validation and error handling

### Part 3: Practice with Arrays (10 points)

Completed 10 exercises demonstrating array manipulation techniques:

- Array creation using literal notation and constructor methods
- Adding, removing, and accessing array elements
- Iteration using `for` and `for-in` loops
- Sorting and reversing arrays
- Merging arrays with `concat()`
- Array method applications (e.g., `pop()`, `delete`)

### Part 4: Product Inventory Management System (20 points)

Built a console-based inventory management system using multi-dimensional arrays:

- Product data storage (SKU, name, quantity, price)
- Command menu interface (view, update, exit)
- Product display sorted by SKU
- Inventory update functionality via user prompts
- Program termination handling

### Part 5: Practice with the Event Model (5 points)

Implemented various event handling approaches:

- Inline HTML event handlers
- DOM Element method (`onclick` property)
- `addEventListener()` with named functions
- `addEventListener()` with anonymous callback functions
- Script placement in `<head>` tag using event listeners

## Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- DOM API
- Console API

## Key Concepts Demonstrated

- Function declarations and expressions
- Pass by value vs. pass by reference
- Event handling patterns
- Array manipulation and iteration
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Input validation
- Control flow and conditionals
